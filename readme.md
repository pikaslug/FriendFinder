# FriendFinder - The Black Panther Edition Node.js, Express & Heroku

Live version: https://stormy-harbor-80202.herokuapp.com/

A web-based application built with Node JS and Express and deployed to Heroku to help users find friends based upon personality traits


### Overview
This is an example project commonly used in coding bootcamps run by [Trilogy Education Services] (https://www.trilogyed.com/) (UC Berkeley Extension, Rutgers, UCLA Extension, Columbia Engineering, Penn etc). You are free to use this repo to help you understand your assignment. No credit needed. Just learn the process for yourself along the way!

## Project Scope

In this activity, you'll build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 


### Project Folder Setup

Your project folder setup should be very simple and look something like this:

```
